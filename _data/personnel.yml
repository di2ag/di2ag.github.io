  bio: >-
    Dr. Eugene Santos, Jr. (born 1968) received his Ph.D. ('92) in Computer Science from Brown University.
    He is currently Professor of Engineering at the Thayer School of Engineering and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science 
    at Dartmouth College. Dr. Santosâ€™ work on artificial intelligence intersects the areas of information, 
    cognition, human factors, and mathematics. His current focus is on computational intent, dynamic human behavior, and 
    decision-making with an emphasis on learning nonlinear and emergent behaviors and explainable AI. Dr. Santos has 
    applied his work with the goal of better understanding how we, both as individuals and our society, can best 
    leverage knowledge through AI to improve our world for social good. These application areas include computational social systems  group to individual 
    decision-making, opinion and belief change, socio-cultural attitudes and factors, and social resilience; 
    user and team modeling  inferring user intentions and needs, surgical errors and team intention gaps, and 
    effective use of text and data analytics; and, cybersecurity  insider threat and deception detection, misinformation vs. 
    disinformation, and adversarial intent and course of action analysis. He was appointed to the State of Vermont 
    Taskforce on AI, serves on the Board of Directors for Sigma Xi as the Northeast Region Director, and is a 2019 Public 
    Voices fellow of the OpEd Project. Dr. Santos was Editor-in-Chief for the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics (formerly IEEE 
    Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part B) from 2008-2013. He is a Fellow of the AAAS and IEEE.
